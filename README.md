# Recognition-of-Vehicle-License-Plate

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust license plate recognition system through the utilization of traditional image processing techniques. The focus is on designing and implementing methods that ensure both efficiency and accuracy in identifying vehicle license plates within static images. By employing conventional methodologies, the project aims to harness established image processing algorithms to extract relevant information from license plates effectively. The emphasis on traditional techniques underscores the commitment to reliability and stability, providing a solid foundation for the development of a high-performance license plate recognition system. This approach aligns with the goal of creating a solution that not only meets the demands of accurate identification but also adheres to established practices in image processing for optimal results.
